Jquery Mobile 101

jQuery Mobile is to mobile what jQuery UI is to desktop. It's a touch optimised framework that makes building mobile optimised sites and apps a breeze for anyone beginning in the world of mobile application development using web technologies.

The team behind jQuery mobile have set out to make a framework that can be used along with jQuery core and make developing a mobile site as painless as possible, and they have pretty much delivered. If you have any experience at all with markup, getting started with jQuery mobile will not be a problem at all.
